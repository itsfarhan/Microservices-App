# Microservices Application with Spring Boot

## What is a Microservices Application?

A microservices application is an architectural style in which a complex software system is composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Key characteristics include:

- **Decomposition:** Breaking down the application into small, self-contained services.
- **Independence:** Each microservice operates independently of others.
- **Autonomy:** Microservices are developed and maintained by small, cross-functional teams.
- **APIs and Communication:** Services communicate through well-defined APIs.
- **Scalability:** Microservices can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Resilience:** Failures in one microservice should not affect the entire application.

## Overview

This microservices application is built using Java Spring Boot and incorporates several key technologies for creating a scalable and modular system. The application is designed with microservices architecture, making it flexible, maintainable, and capable of independent scaling.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A powerful framework for building Java-based microservices.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Used for data persistence, enabling seamless interaction with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Eureka:** Service discovery tool for locating and managing microservices.
- **Feign:** Declarative web service client to simplify HTTP requests between microservices.
- **API Gateway:** A centralized entry point that manages and routes requests to microservices.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple microservices instances to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance.
- **PostgreSQL:** A robust relational database management system for data storage.
